Application review for ProActive

1. Total of a day's work should not exceed 12 hours in timehseet

2. In timehseet the project already added are initially disabled, but two project names appear on press of add button
	
	ADDITION: Existing hours cannot be deleted. Even if set to zero. The zero is not updated in worksheet.
			  If resource, project and date is same; the hours should sum up in one row

3. Estimated days should appear in map resource module to ease the work allocation 

4. Label for status of approval should be present as color of text is not appealing (Submit/Approved/Rejected)
	There will be two possibilities
	1. Sumbitted -> Rejected -> Reason
	2. Submitted -> Approved

5.Input for Project should be first, in expense form, then head, then justification(instead of title). Hide frequency for now as it does not match with current agenda

6. No conflict of authority between two admin account. Exclusive project creation
